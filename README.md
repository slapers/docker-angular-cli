# Docker image with angular cli and chromium xvfb

This image contains the angular cli and chromium xvfb to run headless testing.

It is based on https://github.com/mark-adams/docker-chromium-xvfb
If you just want chromium xvfb check out his work !

I use this container for ci purposes, and therefor added angular cli to speed up my ci tasks.
